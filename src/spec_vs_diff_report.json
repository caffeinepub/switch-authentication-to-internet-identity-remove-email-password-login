  "summary": "Core Internet Identity sign-in/out UI and a Principal-keyed profile backend/onboarding flow were added. However, the diff appears to modify/add files that were explicitly marked immutable, and there is no direct evidence that the required generated image assets were added under the specified public path.",

      "reason": "The diff shows these immutable paths being added/changed (they appear in the added files list), which violates the constraint/AC that they must not be edited.",
